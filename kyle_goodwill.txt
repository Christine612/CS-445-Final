10. Give two examples of each of the following Software Engineering productivity mechanisms: 
a.	Clarity via conciseness
	Shorter easier to read code
	
	Examples:
	assert_greater_than_or_equal_to(a, 7) vs. a.should_be >= 7
	Metaprogramming in Ruby

b.	Synthesis
	Generate code rather than write it yourself
	
	Examples:
	rails new - Creating the rails file structure
	Migrations in rails to create database tables automatically
	
c.	Reuse
	Reuse old code instead of writing new code

	Examples:
	Create functions to be used to the same thing over and over
	Design patterns to use the same solution on many different problems

d.	Automation via Tools
	Replace tedious manual tasks with automation to save time

	Examples:
	RSpec
	Cucumber

29.	Answer the following:
a.	Define and describe the DOM
	The DOM is the Document Object Model, a language independent hierarchical representation of a HTML or XML document, and it contains all of the different tags in a web page document as nodes. The nodes are then placed into a structure called the DOM tree which organizes the nodes into an order that can be accessed by Javascript to read and manipulate the page.
b.	When user interaction generates a browser event, what can JavaScript code do with respect to the DOM?
	Javascript can inspect the DOM elements and their values, as well as change the values and their attributes.
c.	Define and describe AJAX.
	AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML, it performs background HTTP requests to the server asynchrously without redrawing the page.
d.	What tool do we use to test JavaScript and AJAX?
	Jasmine is the tool used to test AJAX and Javascript, it is based upon RSpec
e.	What is the advantage of using AJAX to make HTTP requests to a Web server?
	The advantage of using AJAX to make requests to a web server is that content on the page can be changed dynamically without the need to redraw the page.
f.	Define and describe 'graceful degradation'.
	A website that is built to gracefully degrade is intended to be viewed first by the most modern browsers, and then as older, less feature-rich browsers view it should degrade in a way that is still functional, but with fewer features.
